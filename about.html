            <!-- <h3>Invisible Woman, Invisible Problems</h3> -->
            <p>
                The theme of this year is "Sustainable Solution for Widows Financial Independence '
                A theme that is very apt for such a time as this.
                There has to be a sustainable solution for the widows independence.
            </p>

            <p>
                International Widows’ Day 2022 is observed as an awareness program among the public all over the world.   International Widows' Day was introduced to address the poverty and injustice faced by widows and their children around the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                Widows are usually removed from their inheritance rights to a piece of land or nothing at all,  some are forced into unwanted marriages. Widows are often subjected to a great deal of violence. This type of violence is very common in our society. Widows are frequently subjected to physical and mental abuse and withdrawal of children from school.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main aim of International Widow’s day is to provide education to the widows’ children, provide them with healthcare facilities, and develop various resources and policies to empower widows.
            </p>

            <p>
                This step can lead widows to have quality in society and have equal rights and freedom. It is necessary to understand a widow’s conditions and serve equal rights as the rest of the women possess.
            </p>

            <p>
                International Widow’s Day 2022's theme tend to highlight the fact that for many societies a woman’s identity is attached to her partner and after his death, the problems faced by her are ignored by policymakers who don’t give any special attention to the widowed woman. Partners are the ones who treat each other's rights as if they were their own. They share the burdens and confront the issues together. When a woman's spouse passes away, she is left alone, and her troubles become invisible to the rest of society. Widows are even stripped of their rights.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It's an order and agenda after God's heart according to James 1:27
            </p>

            <p>
                Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.
